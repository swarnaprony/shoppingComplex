Shopping Complex

Shopping Complex is a website where users can buy and sell items. My aim with this Full Stack project was the design and development of an online Shopping platform. The implementation follows a REST-api architecture and some of the key features are:

Secure Authorisation and Authentication
Role-based Access Control
Mail Client within the Application
Recommendations using Matrix Factorisation
